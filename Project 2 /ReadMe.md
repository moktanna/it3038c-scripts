This code creates a snake game using Python. I used the link in Project 1 which was:

When running this you want to make sure the indentation is correct. It's very sensitive. The screen you should first see should have a Score and High Score counter on top. In the middle is the snake and the purple ball is the fruit. Every fruit the player gets is 10+ and it can count up the high score as long as you don't exit out.
