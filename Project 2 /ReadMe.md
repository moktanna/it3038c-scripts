This code creates a snake game using Python. You can use VSCode. I used the link in Project 1 which was:

When running this you want to make sure the indentation is correct. It's very sensitive. The screen you should first see should have a Score and High Score counter on top. In the middle is the black snake and the purple ball is the fruit. To move the snake it is the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. Every fruit the player gets is 10+ and it can count up the high score as long as you don't exit out. If it hits its tail, wall, or body part that means game over. The game will reset by itself and once you start moving the key it will start right away.

As you keep playing the snake should get longer and longer. As the snake gets longer the game will become faster and harder for you to play. The game speed should reset once you die and come back alive.
