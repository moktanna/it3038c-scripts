## Final Project: Hangman Game by Neha Moktan

# Run the Game

Download the file into any location you want. Then cd into the location in the command prompt. Down below I have shown you how to cd into the file which has my Hangman code. 

```powershell
PS C:\>   cd C:\(file path)
```
![cd into the file](https://github.com/moktanna/it3038c-scripts/assets/142691046/73b39b2c-f3bd-426b-a415-e3fd00280e82)


Then run the file that you have downloaded or created. You can run this by using python file_name.py.

```powershell
PS C:\>   python final_project.py
```
![run](https://github.com/moktanna/it3038c-scripts/assets/142691046/dc22446b-1d60-4c5f-8260-98d42befd7aa)
